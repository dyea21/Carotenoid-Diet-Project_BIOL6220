# Carotenoid-Diet-Project_BIOL6220
Poison frog color analysis for Practical Computing Fall 2022

## Project Justification
Carotenoids are responsible for the production of orange and red pigmentation and also play a role in developmental pathways. This project was started as a dissertation chapter focused on spectral analyses. 
Ranitomeya imitator individuals were fed carotenoid rich diets in one treatment and carotenoid defficient diets in another. Two morphs were analyzed: Varadero and Sauce. Images were captured during these analyses and were intended only for identification purposes. 
This piece of the project is investigating if a carotenoid rich diet will increase the amount of orange pigmentation along with the brightness of the orange pigmentation compared to the black pigmentation that is also present in these individuals. 
Because the images were not standardized, only dorsal coloration was used and any coloration present on the visible legs was not taken into consideration during the quanitification.
