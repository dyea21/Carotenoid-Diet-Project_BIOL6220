Carotenoid-Diet-Project_BIOL6220

## Project Justification
Carotenoids are responsible for the production of orange and red pigmentation and also play a role in developmental pathways. This project was started as a dissertation chapter focused on spectral analyses. 
Ranitomeya imitator individuals were fed carotenoid rich diets in one treatment and carotenoid defficient diets in another. Two morphs were analyzed: Varadero and Sauce. Images were captured during these analyses and were intended only for identification purposes. 
This piece of the project is investigating if a carotenoid rich diet will increase the amount of orange pigmentation along with the brightness of the orange pigmentation compared to the black pigmentation that is also present in these individuals. 
Because the images were not standardized, only dorsal coloration was used and any coloration present on the visible legs was not taken into consideration during the quanitification.

## Image Analysis Explanation
Image analysis was conducted using GIMP and FIJI, with Excel being used for the quanitifcation of color variation (see Image Analysis using GIMP, FIJI, Excel file for detailed steps). The images were analyzed using FIJI tracing of colors because these images were not standardized and were not meant for this type of image analysis. Another way to analyze images is to create a binary photo and convert it to black and white, where FIJI will calculate the area of white. This was not able to be done for this project due to the amount of glare present in the images.

## Statistical Justification
I conducted two different t-tests, one for each morph (Varadero and Sauce) to identify if the ratio of orange to black pigmentation changed between a carotenoid rich and carotenoid deficient diet. 

## Explanation of Results
There was not a significant difference in the orange to black ratio of Sauce individuals in the carotenoid rich (n=10) and carotenoid defficient (n=4) diets (p=0.43, t=0.81). There was a significant difference in the orange to black ratio of Varadero individuals in the carotenoid rich (n=10) and carotenoid defficient (n=10) diets (p=0.009, t=.94).
